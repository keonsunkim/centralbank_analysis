       "\"  Recent indicators of spending and production have softened. Nonetheless, job gains have been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher food and energy prices, and broader price pressures.  Russia's war against Ukraine is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The war and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.  \""

The COVID-19 pandemic is causing tremendous human and economic hardship across the United States and around the world. Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. The sectors most adversely affected by the pandemic remain weak but have shown improvement. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.  The path of the economy will depend significantly on the course of the virus, including progress on vaccinations. The ongoing public health crisis continues to weigh on the economy, and risks to the economic outlook remain.  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation running persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer‑term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved. The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee's assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time. In addition, the Federal Reserve will continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage‑backed securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee's maximum employment and price stability goals. These asset purchases help foster smooth market functioning and accommodative financial conditions, thereby supporting the flow of credit to households and businesses.  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

McKay, Senior Research Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis  Developments in Financial Markets and Open Market Operations  The manager of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) turned first to a discussion of financial developments. Over the intermeeting period, there were significant swings in asset prices, and financial conditions tightened, on net, as market participants assessed incoming information about the economy. In the United States, near-term policy rate expectations shifted markedly toward the end of the period, particularly after the release of the May consumer price index (CPI) report. Ahead of the release of the report, market expectations reflected a broad consensus that there would be 50 basis point rate increases at both the June and July FOMC meetings. After the release of the higher-than-expected inflation data, policy-sensitive rates pointed instead to a considerable probability of 75 basis point moves at both the June and July meetings. The market-implied path of the federal funds rate moved higher at longer horizons as well. Market participants noted elevated uncertainty about the economic and monetary policy outlook.  Across the yield curve, rates on nominal Treasury securities ended the period significantly higher, primarily reflecting the revision in the outlook for monetary policy and the associated rise in real yields. Market-based measures of inflation compensation continued to indicate expectations that inflation would decline notably in coming quarters, and measures of medium-term inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period. Market participants reported that while liquidity conditions in the market for Treasury securities had been affected by the elevated volatility in rates and larger trades were having an increased effect on pricing, overall market functioning had held up. Responding to higher interest rates and some concerns about the growth outlook, equity prices moved substantially lower over the period.  The manager turned next to a discussion of developments related to foreign central banks. Most major foreign central banks were proceeding on a path of removing policy accommodation in order to address elevated levels of inflation. Several—including those of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—had raised their policy rates 50 basis points over the intermeeting period, and some signaled the potential need for more forceful tightening in order to address inflation risks. The European Central Bank (ECB) announced an end to its asset purchase program and signaled an intention to lift policy rates in July. Meanwhile, the stance of monetary policy in Japan was generally expected to remain highly accommodative, though recent upward pressure on Japanese government bond yields had led the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to step up its efforts to defend its yield curve control target. On balance, market participants were focused on the largely synchronous shift toward monetary policy tightening across most advanced economies.  Regarding money market developments, the manager noted that the 50 basis point increase in the target range at the May FOMC meeting passed through to the effective federal funds rate and was also transmitted to other overnight rates. The federal funds rate held steady at 83 basis points throughout the period, while the Secured Overnight Financing Rate softened, on net, falling to the bottom of the federal funds target range later in the period. Contacts attributed the downward pressure on secured rates to high liquidity levels and declining Treasury bill supply, as well as elevated uncertainty about the interest rate path, which had increased demand for short-term investments. In this environment, participation in the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility increased, and a greater share of activity in overnight private repurchase agreement (repo) markets was conducted by lenders who lacked access to the facility. The manager noted that, if ON RRP usage continued to rise, it may be appropriate at some point to consider further lifting the per-counterparty limit. Over the longer term, ON RRP usage was expected to fall, with the reduction in the size of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet resulting in a gradual rise in money market rates relative to the ON RRP rate.  The deputy manager turned next to a discussion of Federal Reserve operations and related topics. In accordance with the directive to the Open Market Desk, the reduction in SOMA securities holdings began in June, under the initial monthly caps on redemptions of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $17.5 billion for agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Under current staff projections, the SOMA portfolio was anticipated to decline roughly $400 billion by the end of 2022. As noted in the recent SOMA annual report and reported in the Board\\'s first-quarter financial statements for the Federal Reserve System, the SOMA portfolio had an unrealized loss, reflecting the increase in longer-term interest rates. Unrealized losses had no implications for Federal Reserve income and would eventually fall to zero as securities reached maturity. The staff projected that SOMA net income would decline and potentially turn negative, with increases in the target range lifting the interest expense on some liabilities, and that this eventuality could result in a deferred asset entry on the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet. Neither unrealized losses on the Federal Reserve\\'s existing securities portfolio nor negative net income would impair the implementation of monetary policy or the Federal Reserve\\'s ability to achieve its dual-mandate objectives.  On other operational matters, the deputy manager noted that, over the intermeeting period, the Desk onboarded three depository institutions as new counterparties for the standing repo facility (SRF), resulting in a total of nine depository institutions approved, to date, as SRF counterparties.  By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified the Desk\\'s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period. There were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the System\\'s account during the intermeeting period.  Staff Review of the Economic Situation  The information available at the time of the June 14–15 meeting suggested that U.S. real gross domestic product (GDP) was rebounding to a moderate rate of increase in the second quarter after having declined in the first quarter. The labor market remained very tight, but there were some signs that momentum was slowing. Consumer price inflation—as measured by the 12‑month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)—remained elevated in April, and available information suggested that inflation was still elevated in May.  Total nonfarm payroll employment rose solidly in April and May, though the pace of increase was slower than in the first quarter, and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 3.6 percent. The unemployment rates for African Americans and for Hispanics were little changed, on net, though both rates remained noticeably higher than the national average. On net, the labor force participation rate edged down between March and May, while the employment-to-population ratio was unchanged. The private-sector job openings rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, edged lower in April but remained at a high level. Nominal wage growth remained elevated, with average hourly earnings having risen 5.2 percent over the 12 months ending in May, and the increases were widespread across industries.  Consumer price inflation remained elevated. Total PCE price inflation was 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April, and core PCE price inflation, which excludes changes in consumer energy prices and many consumer food prices, was 4.9 percent over the same period. The trimmed mean measure of 12‑month PCE price inflation constructed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas was 3.8 percent in April, nearly 2 percentage points higher than its year-earlier rate of increase. In May, the 12-month change in the CPI was 8.6 percent, while core CPI inflation was 6.0 percent over the same period. Measures of inflation expectations derived from surveys of professional forecasters and of consumers generally suggested that inflation was expected to remain high in the short run but then fall back toward levels consistent with a longer-run rate of 2 percent.  Production and spending indicators were mixed but generally remained strong. Consumer spending and industrial production posted sizable gains in April. However, retail sales declined in May, data on home sales and single-family housing starts moved down in April, some indicators of manufacturing activity weakened in May, and the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers measure of consumer sentiment decreased noticeably in the preliminary June reading. Supply disruptions appeared to have improved in some sectors (such as general merchandise retailers) but to have deteriorated in others (such as materials for home construction). On balance, the available indicators suggested that private domestic final purchases were increasing at a slower pace in the second quarter than in the first quarter. And with the available trade data for April pointing to a rebound in exports and a moderation in import growth in the second quarter, GDP growth appeared to be rebounding after having declined in the first quarter.  Regarding trade, real imports of goods stepped back in April from their exceptional strength in March, driven by a decline in consumer goods imports. By contrast, real goods exports grew in both March and April after declining in the previous two months, following some normalization in categories such as soybeans and pharmaceuticals, which can exhibit large and idiosyncratic changes. Exports and imports of services continued to be held back by an incomplete recovery of international travel. The nominal U.S. international trade deficit widened to a record size in March and then reversed that widening in April.  Incoming data suggested that the global reverberations from lockdown measures to deal with the spread of the COVID-19 virus in China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine slowed foreign economic growth. In China, activity indicators pointed to a sizable restraint on economic activity. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continued to have an imprint on foreign activity, with persistent stresses in global commodity markets and declining consumer and business confidence, especially in Europe. Inflation abroad moved higher, driven by further increases in consumer energy and food prices as well as some additional broadening of price pressures to core goods and services. Central banks around the world further tightened their monetary policy stances to curb high inflation.  Staff Review of the Financial Situation  Over the intermeeting period, U.S. Treasury yields and the market-implied federal funds rate path moved substantially higher on net. Broad domestic equity price indexes declined considerably, on balance, amid elevated market volatility. In most advanced foreign economies (AFEs), sovereign yields also increased further, and foreign equity price indexes moved lower. Despite further increases in borrowing costs, financing conditions in domestic credit markets remained generally accommodative. The credit quality of firms, municipalities, and households remained largely stable, although the outlook for credit quality had begun to deteriorate somewhat.  Since the previous FOMC meeting, 2-, 5-, and 10-year nominal Treasury yields increased considerably on net. Early in the intermeeting period, Treasury yields moved lower amid rising concerns about a weakening U.S. growth outlook and Federal Reserve communications perceived as lowering the chances of large policy rate hikes at upcoming meetings. However, yields increased late in the period, with economic data releases largely being interpreted as highlighting the possibility of a more aggressive tightening of monetary policy. The expected federal funds rate path—implied by a straight read of overnight index swap quotes—also increased notably on balance. Real yields increased more than their nominal counterparts, while inflation compensation implied by Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities declined.  Broad equity price indexes fell sharply over the intermeeting period on net. The stock price declines were largely associated with mixed corporate earnings news early in the period and increasing concerns about the economic outlook amid global policy tightening. One-month option-implied volatility on the S&P 500 index—the VIX—increased moderately, on balance, remaining elevated relative to its historical distribution and significantly above average pre-pandemic levels. Spreads on investment-grade and, to a greater extent, speculative-grade corporate bonds widened notably, on net, reaching levels comparable with those at the end of 2018. This widening of spreads was associated with increased concerns about the outlook for corporate credit amid monetary policy tightening. Since the previous FOMC meeting, spreads on municipal bonds narrowed substantially, on net, moving near levels observed for several years before the pandemic, as investor demand exhibited some recovery over much of the period from earlier weak levels.  Conditions in short-term funding markets remained stable over the intermeeting period, with the May increase in the Federal Reserve\\'s administered rates passing through promptly to overnight money market rates. Spreads on longer-tenor commercial paper (CP) and negotiable certificates of deposit narrowed moderately, with no signs of spillovers beyond the stablecoin market following the collapse of a large algorithmic stablecoin. Indeed, CP outstanding increased slightly over the period. Money market fund (MMF) net yields across all fund types rose notably, as increases in administered rates passed through to money market instruments. Secured overnight rates softened significantly relative to the ON RRP offering rate since the May FOMC meeting, with the downward pressure on rates attributed to continuing declines in net Treasury bill issuance, elevated demand for collateral in the form of Treasury securities, and MMFs maintaining very short portfolio maturities amid uncertainty about the pace of anticipated policy rate increases. Consistent with the downward pressure on repo rates, daily take-up in the ON RRP facility increased further.  Sovereign yields in most AFEs rose over the intermeeting period amid investors\\' concerns about further inflationary pressures and major central banks\\' policy communications suggesting a firmer stance of policy. Interest rate volatility in AFEs increased, consistent with increased uncertainty about the path of policy rates. Concerns about the global growth outlook weighed on equity prices, and the broad dollar edged up. Implied equity price volatility remained at elevated levels. Japanese yields and equity prices, however, ended the period about unchanged, as the BOJ reaffirmed its accommodative monetary policy stance. Sovereign bond spreads over German bund yields for euro-area peripheral countries widened further. These moves were partially retraced following an unscheduled meeting of the ECB on June 15, at which the ECB indicated that it would take action to address potential fragmentation risk in euro-area sovereign bond markets. Outflows from emerging market-dedicated funds intensified in early May, especially from local currency bond funds, and credit spreads in emerging market economies widened moderately.  In domestic credit markets, financing conditions for most businesses and households remained generally accommodative over the intermeeting period. Credit remained widely available, particularly to higher-rated firms and consumers with higher credit scores. Gross nonfinancial corporate bond issuance slowed in May, especially among speculative-grade issuers, amid elevated market volatility and high yields. Gross institutional leveraged loan issuance decelerated and initial public offering volumes remained extremely slow in May, while gross issuance of municipal bonds remained robust.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) and commercial real estate (CRE) loans on banks\\' balance sheets expanded at a rapid pace in April and May. Issuance of both agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) stepped down slightly in May from its strong pace earlier in the year. Small business loan originations through April were in line with pre-pandemic levels and indicated that credit appeared to be available.  Residential mortgage credit remained widely available through May for most borrowers. While refinance volumes continued trending lower in April and May amid higher mortgage rates, outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit at commercial banks posted the first significant increase in more than a decade, likely reflecting a substitution by homeowners away from cash-out refinances. In consumer credit markets, auto loans outstanding grew at a robust pace in the first quarter, consistent with a rebound in auto sales, but slowed in April and May. Credit card balances at commercial banks rose in April at the fastest pace seen in recent decades, but growth slowed in May.  Borrowing costs had continued to increase in many sectors since the previous FOMC meeting. Yields on nonfinancial corporate bonds remained well above pre-pandemic levels, and new issuance spreads for institutional leveraged loans ticked up in May. Bank interest rates for both C&I and CRE loans also increased. Among small businesses that borrow on a regular basis, the share facing higher borrowing costs rose in both April and May. Borrowing costs for residential mortgage loans increased significantly over the intermeeting period, in line with the increases in MBS and Treasury yields, reaching their highest levels since 2010. In consumer credit markets, rates on auto loans and new credit card offers continued to trend upward.  Despite the historically low volumes of defaults on both corporate bonds and leveraged loans in April, in the later weeks of the intermeeting period the volume of credit rating downgrades of leveraged loans exceeded the volume of upgrades. In addition, market indicators of future default expectations of businesses deteriorated to some extent, as investors appeared to mark down their assessment of the macroeconomic outlook.  Credit quality of business loans on banks\\' books remained sound, with C&I and CRE delinquency rates continuing to be low through March. Nonetheless, banks allocated net positive loan loss provisions in the first quarter of this year. This development reversed a pattern of loan loss reserves being released throughout last year and reflected concerns about the credit quality outlook. Delinquency rates on CMBS and small business loans continued to decline, and the credit quality of municipal securities remained strong.  Household credit quality remained solid, with the share of consumers with subprime credit scores still near historical lows. In addition, mortgage delinquencies and the share of mortgages in forbearance both continued to trend down in recent months. While nonprime auto loan delinquency rates edged down a touch in the first quarter, credit card delinquency rates for account holders with below-prime credit scores inched up from low levels. The sizable increases in credit card purchase volumes through March were roughly offset by high levels of credit card payments, thus increasing household borrowing only slightly.  Staff Economic Outlook  The projection for U.S. economic activity prepared by the staff for the June FOMC meeting implied a trajectory for real GDP that was lower than in the May projection. The staff continued to project that GDP growth would rebound in the second quarter and remain solid over the remainder of the year. However, monetary policy was assumed to be less accommodative than in the previous projection, and the recent and prospective tightening of financial conditions led the staff to reduce its GDP growth forecast for the second half of 2022 and for 2023. The level of real GDP was still expected to remain well above potential over the projection period, though the gap was projected to narrow significantly this year and to narrow a little further next year. Labor market conditions also were expected to remain very tight, albeit somewhat less so than in the previous projection.  With regard to PCE price inflation, the staff revised up its projection for the second half of 2022 in response to stronger-than-expected wage growth and the staff\\'s assessment that the boost to inflation from supply–demand imbalances in the economy, including in food and energy markets, would be more persistent than previously assumed. All told, total PCE price inflation was expected to be 5.0 percent in 2022, while core inflation was expected to be 4.1 percent. PCE price inflation was then expected to step down to 2.4 percent in 2023 and to 2.0 percent in 2024, as energy prices were forecast to decline and as supply–demand imbalances were projected to diminish because of slowing aggregate demand and an easing of supply constraints. Similarly, core inflation was projected to slow to 2.6 percent in 2023 and to 2.2 percent in 2024.  The staff continued to judge that the risks to the baseline projection for real activity were skewed to the downside and that the risks to the inflation projection were skewed to the upside. The staff judged that the ongoing war in Ukraine remained a possible source of even greater upward pressure on energy and commodity prices, while the war and adverse developments associated with China\\'s zero-COVID policy were both perceived as increasing the risk that supply chain disruptions and production constraints would be further exacerbated in the United States and abroad.  Participants\\' Views on Current Conditions and the Economic Outlook  In conjunction with this FOMC meeting, participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2022 through 2024 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy, including the path of the federal funds rate. The longer-run projections represented each participant\\'s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. A Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) was released to the public following the conclusion of the meeting.  In their discussion of current economic conditions, participants noted that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures. Participants recognized that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship for the Ukrainian people. Participants judged that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. In addition, participants indicated that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. Against this background, participants stated that they were highly attentive to inflation risks.  With regard to the economic outlook, participants noted that recent indicators suggested that real GDP growth was expanding in the current quarter, with consumption spending remaining strong. Participants generally judged that growth in business fixed investment appeared to be slowing, and activity in the housing sector appeared to be softening, in part as a result of a sharp rise in mortgage rates. Correspondingly, participants indicated that they had revised down their projections of real GDP growth for this year, consistent with ongoing supply chain disruptions and tighter financial conditions. Participants noted that the imbalance between supply and demand across a wide range of product markets was contributing to upward pressure on inflation. They saw an appropriate firming of monetary policy and associated tighter financial conditions as playing a central role in helping address this imbalance and in supporting the Federal Reserve\\'s goals of maximum employment and price stability. An easing of supply bottlenecks, a further rise in labor force participation, and the waning effects of pandemic-related fiscal policy support were cited as additional factors that could help reduce the supply–demand imbalances in the economy and therefore lower inflation over the next few years. That said, the timing and magnitude of these effects were uncertain. Participants saw little evidence to date of a substantial improvement in supply constraints, and some of them judged that the economic effects of these constraints were likely to persist longer than they had previously anticipated. Participants stressed the need to adjust the stance of policy in response to incoming information regarding the evolution of these and other factors.  In their discussion of the household sector, participants indicated that consumption spending had remained robust, in part reflecting strong balance sheets in the household sector and a tight labor market. Several participants noted that household spending patterns appeared to be shifting away from goods to services. Several participants indicated that some of their contacts reported that the pace of consumer spending, though strong, was beginning to moderate. One reason cited for this moderation was that the purchasing power of households was being reduced by higher prices for food, energy, and other essentials. Participants generally expected higher mortgage interest rates to contribute to further declines in home sales, and a couple of participants noted that housing activity in their Districts had begun to slow noticeably. Against the backdrop of rising borrowing costs and higher gasoline and food prices, a couple of participants commented that consumer sentiment had dropped notably in June, according to the preliminary reading in the Michigan survey.  With respect to the business sector, participants observed that their contacts generally reported that sales remained strong, although some contacts indicated that sales had begun to slow and that they had become less optimistic about the outlook. In many industries, the ability of firms to meet demand continued to be limited by labor shortages and supply chain bottlenecks. Firms relying on international sources for their inputs were seen as encountering particularly acute supply chain disruptions. Supply constraints, labor shortages, and rising input costs were also reportedly limiting energy and agricultural producers\\' ability to take advantage of the higher prices of their products by investing and expanding their production capacity. Similarly, a few participants noted that, in other sectors of the economy, their contacts reported that they were postponing investment or construction projects because of rising input and financing costs. With supply challenges still widespread, contacts continued to assess that supply constraints overall were significant, and many of them judged that these constraints were likely to persist for some time.  Participants noted that the demand for labor continued to outstrip available supply across many parts of the economy. They observed that various indicators pointed to a very tight labor market. These indicators included an unemployment rate near a 50-year low, job vacancies at historical highs, and elevated nominal wage growth. Additionally, most business contacts had continued to report persistent wage pressures as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining workers. However, some contacts reported that, because of previous wage hikes, hiring and retention had improved and pressure for additional wage increases appeared to be receding.  Employment growth, while moderating somewhat from its pace earlier in the year, had remained robust. Several participants observed that labor force participation remained below its pre-pandemic level because of the unusually large number of retirements during the pandemic and judged that the labor force participation rate was unlikely to move up considerably in the near term. A couple of participants raised the possibility that tight labor markets would spur investment in automation by firms, boosting labor productivity.  While labor markets were anticipated to remain tight in the near term, participants expected labor demand and supply to come into better balance over time, helping to ease upward pressure on wages and prices. As in the case of product markets, they anticipated that an appropriate firming of monetary policy would play a central role in helping address imbalances in the labor market. With the tightness in labor markets anticipated to diminish over time, participants generally expected the unemployment rate to increase, as the median projection of the unemployment rate in the June SEP showed a gradual rise over the next few years, reaching 4.1 percent in 2024. In light of the very high level of job vacancies, a number of participants judged that the expected moderation in labor demand relative to supply might primarily affect vacancies and have a less significant effect on the unemployment rate.  Participants noted that inflation remained much too high and observed that it continued to run well above the Committee\\'s longer-run 2 percent objective, with total PCE prices having risen 6.3 percent over the 12 months ending in April. They also observed that the 12-month change in the CPI in May came in above expectations. Participants were concerned that the May CPI release indicated that inflation pressures had yet to show signs of abating, and a number of them saw it as solidifying the view that inflation would be more persistent than they had previously anticipated. They commented on the hardship caused by elevated inflation, with low- and moderate-income households especially affected. These households had to spend more of their budgets on essentials such as food, energy, and housing and were less able to bear the rapidly rising costs of these essentials. In that context, some participants noted that their contacts had reported that low- and moderate-income consumers were shifting purchases to lower-cost goods. Participants also stressed that persistently high inflation would impede the achievement of maximum employment on a sustained basis.  Participants judged that strong aggregate demand, together with supply constraints that had been larger and longer lasting than expected, continued to contribute to price pressures across a broad array of goods and services. They noted that the surge in prices of oil and other commodities associated with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine was boosting gasoline and food prices and putting additional upward pressure on inflation. Participants commented on the global nature of inflation pressures, and a few of them added that many foreign central banks were also firming the stance of monetary policy. Several participants judged that a shift in spending from goods to services was likely to be associated with less upward pressure on prices in the goods sector, but also an intensification of upward pressure on prices in the services sector. Participants had revised up their PCE inflation projections for 2022 in their June SEP submissions, largely in response to higher-than-expected inflation readings and the slower anticipated resolution of supply constraints. They expected that the appropriate firming of monetary policy and an eventual easing of supply and demand imbalances would bring inflation back down to levels roughly consistent with the Committee\\'s longer-run objectives by 2024 and keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored.  Participants observed that some measures of inflation expectations had moved up recently, including the staff index of common inflation expectations and the expectations of inflation over the next 5 to 10 years provided in the Michigan survey. With respect to market-based measures, however, a few participants noted that medium-term measures of inflation compensation fell over the intermeeting period and longer-term measures were unchanged. While measures of longer-term inflation expectations derived from surveys of households, professional forecasters, and market participants were generally judged to be broadly consistent with the Committee\\'s longer-run 2 percent inflation objective, many participants raised the concern that longer-run inflation expectations could be beginning to drift up to levels inconsistent with the 2 percent objective. These participants noted that, if inflation expectations were to become unanchored, it would be more costly to bring inflation back down to the Committee\\'s objective.  In their discussion of risks, participants emphasized that they were highly attentive to inflation risks and were closely monitoring developments regarding both inflation and inflation expectations. Most agreed that risks to inflation were skewed to the upside and cited several such risks, including those associated with ongoing supply bottlenecks and rising energy and commodity prices. Participants judged that uncertainty about economic growth over the next couple of years was elevated. In that context, a couple of them noted that GDP and gross domestic income had been giving conflicting signals recently regarding the pace of economic growth, making it challenging to determine the economy\\'s underlying momentum. Most participants assessed that the risks to the outlook for economic growth were skewed to the downside. Downside risks included the possibility that a further tightening in financial conditions would have a larger negative effect on economic activity than anticipated as well as the possibilities that the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the COVID-related lockdowns in China would have larger-than-expected effects on economic growth.  In their consideration of the appropriate stance of monetary policy, participants concurred that the labor market was very tight, inflation was well above the Committee\\'s 2 percent inflation objective, and the near-term inflation outlook had deteriorated since the time of the May meeting. Against this backdrop, almost all participants agreed that it was appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 75 basis points at this meeting. One participant favored a 50 basis point increase in the target range at this meeting instead of 75 basis points. All participants judged that it was appropriate to continue the process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve\\'s balance sheet, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve\\'s Balance Sheet that the Committee issued in May. In light of elevated inflation pressures and signs of deterioration in some measures of inflation expectations, all participants reaffirmed their strong commitment to returning inflation to the Committee\\'s 2 percent objective. Participants observed that a return of inflation to the 2 percent objective was necessary for creating conditions conducive to a sustainably strong labor market over time.  In discussing potential policy actions at upcoming meetings, participants continued to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate would be appropriate to achieve the Committee\\'s objectives. In particular, participants judged that an increase of 50 or 75 basis points would likely be appropriate at the next meeting. Participants concurred that the economic outlook warranted moving to a restrictive stance of policy, and they recognized the possibility that an even more restrictive stance could be appropriate if elevated inflation pressures were to persist.  Participants noted that, with the federal funds rate expected to be near or above estimates of its longer-run level later this year, the Committee would then be well positioned to determine the appropriate pace of further policy firming and the extent to which economic developments warranted policy adjustments. They also remarked that the pace of rate increases and the extent of future policy tightening would depend on the incoming data and the evolving outlook for the economy. Many participants noted that the Committee\\'s credibility with regard to bringing inflation back to the 2 percent objective, together with previous communications, had been helpful in shifting market expectations of future policy and had already contributed to a notable tightening of financial conditions that would likely help reduce inflation pressures by restraining aggregate demand. Participants recognized that ongoing policy firming would be appropriate if economic conditions evolved as expected.  At the current juncture, with inflation remaining well above the Committee\\'s objective, participants remarked that moving to a restrictive stance of policy was required to meet the Committee\\'s legislative mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability. In addition, such a stance would be appropriate from a risk management perspective because it would put the Committee in a better position to implement more restrictive policy if inflation came in higher than expected. Many participants judged that a significant risk now facing the Committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the resolve of the Committee to adjust the stance of policy as warranted. On this matter, participants stressed that appropriate firming of monetary policy, together with clear and effective communications, would be essential in restoring price stability.  Participants remarked that developments associated with Russia\\'s invasion of Ukraine, the COVID-related lockdowns in China, and other factors restraining supply conditions would affect the inflation outlook and that it would likely take some time for inflation to move down to the Committee\\'s 2 percent objective. Participants also judged that maintaining a strong labor market during the process of bringing inflation down to 2 percent would depend on many factors affecting demand and supply. Participants recognized that policy firming could slow the pace of economic growth for a time, but they saw the return of inflation to 2 percent as critical to achieving maximum employment on a sustained basis.  Committee Policy Action  In their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting, members agreed that overall economic activity appeared to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter. Job gains had been robust in recent months, and the unemployment rate had remained low. Members also agreed that inflation remained elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, higher energy prices, and broader price pressures.  Members concurred that the invasion of Ukraine by Russia was causing tremendous human and economic hardship. Members agreed that the invasion and related events were creating additional upward pressure on inflation and were weighing on global economic activity. With the effects of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia already materializing, members considered it appropriate to omit from the June statement the sentence conveying the high uncertainty associated with the implications of the invasion for the U.S. economy. Members also agreed that COVID-related lockdowns in China were likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. In light of these developments, members remarked that they remain highly attentive to the upside risks to inflation and would be nimble in responding to incoming data and the evolving outlook.  In their assessment of the monetary policy stance necessary for achieving the Committee\\'s maximum-employment and price-stability goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipated that ongoing increases in the target range would be appropriate. In addition, members agreed that the Committee would continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency MBS, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve\\'s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. One member preferred to raise the target range for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent at this meeting.  Members judged that, with high and widespread inflation pressures and some measures of longer-term inflation expectations moving up somewhat, it would be appropriate for the postmeeting statement to note that the Committee was strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective. As the further firming in the policy stance would likely result in some slowing in economic growth and tempering in labor market conditions, members also agreed to remove the previous statement language that had indicated an expectation that appropriate policy would result in a return of inflation to 2 percent and a strong labor market.  Members agreed that, in assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, they would continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and that they would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate in the event that risks emerged that could impede the attainment of the Committee\\'s goals. They also concurred that their assessments would take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.  At the conclusion of the discussion, the Committee voted to authorize and direct the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the SOMA in accordance with the following domestic policy directive, for release at 2:00 p.m.:  \"Effective June 16, 2022, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to:  The vote also encompassed approval of the statement below for release at 2:00 p.m.:  \"Overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter.

The invasion of Ukraine by Russia is causing tremendous human and economic hardship. The invasion and related events are creating additional upward pressure on inflation and are weighing on global economic activity. In addition, COVID-related lockdowns in China are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions. The Committee is highly attentive to inflation risks.  The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. In support of these goals, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent and anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate. In addition, the Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, as described in the Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve\\'s Balance Sheet that were issued in May. The Committee is strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.  In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee\\'s goals. The Committee\\'s assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.\"  Voting for this action: Jerome H. Powell, John C. Williams, Michelle W. Bowman, Lael Brainard, James Bullard, Lisa D. Cook, Patrick Harker, Philip N. Jefferson, Loretta J. Mester, and Christopher J. Waller.  Voting against this action: Esther L. George.  Patrick Harker voted as an alternate member at this meeting.  President George dissented because she judged that a large increase in the target range for the federal funds rate would add to uncertainty about policy concurrent with the beginning of balance sheet runoff in ways that could unsettle households and businesses and could also adversely affect the ability of small banks to meet the credit needs of their communities.  To support the Committee\\'s decision to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to raise the interest rate paid on reserve balances to 1.65 percent, effective June 16, 2022. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to approve a 3/4 percentage point increase in the primary credit rate to 1.75 percent, effective June 16, 2022.5  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be held on Tuesday–Wednesday, July 26–27, 2022. The meeting adjourned at 10:45 a.m. on June 15, 2022.  Notation Vote  By notation vote completed on May 24, 2022, the Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the Committee meeting held on May 3–4, 2022.  _______________________ James A.

By unanimous vote, responsibility for making decisions on       appeals of denials by the Secretary of the Committee for access to       Committee records was delegated under the provisions of 271.4(d) of       the Committee\\'s Rules Regarding Availability of Information to Ms.       Phillips and, in her absence, to Ms. Yellen.  By unanimous vote, the Committee elected Thomas C. Baxter,       Jr. as Deputy General Counsel from the Federal Reserve Bank of New       York, and William C. Hunter as Associate Economist from the Federal       Reserve Bank of Chicago, to serve until the next election at the first       meeting of the Committee after December 31, 1995, with the       understanding that in the event of the discontinuance of their       official connection with the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and       Chicago respectively, they would cease to have any official connection       with the Federal Open Market Committee.  On January 12, 1995, the continuing rules, regulations, and       other instruments of the Committee had been distributed with the       advice that, in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee,       they were being called to the Committee\\'s attention to give members an       opportunity to raise any questions they might have concerning them.  Members were asked to indicate if they wished to have any of       the instruments in question placed on the agenda, and no requests for       substantive consideration were received. Apart from the updating of       the Manager\\'s title, all of the instruments identified below remained       in effect in their existing forms:  1. Federal Open Market Committee Rules.  2. Authority for the Chairman to appoint a Federal Reserve Bank as       agent to operate the System Account in case the New York Bank is       unable to function.  3. Resolution relating to examinations of the System Open Market       Account.  4. Regulation relating to Open Market Operations of Federal Reserve       Banks.  By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Domestic Open Market       Operations shown below was reaffirmed.  AUTHORIZATION FOR DOMESTIC OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS       Reaffirmed March 28, 1995  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the       Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to the extent necessary to carry out       the most recent domestic policy directive adopted at a meeting of the       Committee:  (a) To buy or sell U.S. Government securities, including         securities of the Federal Financing Bank, and securities that are         direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and         interest by, any agency of the United States in the open market, from         or to securities dealers and foreign and international accounts         maintained at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash,         regular, or deferred delivery basis, for the System Open Market         Account at market prices, and, for such Account, to exchange maturing         U.S. Government and Federal agency securities with the Treasury or the         individual agencies or to allow them to mature without replacement;         provided that the aggregate amount of U.S. Government and Federal         agency securities held in such Account (including forward commitments)         at the close of business on the day of a meeting of the Committee at         which action is taken with respect to a domestic policy directive         shall not be increased or decreased by more than $8.0 billion during         the period commencing with the opening of business on the day         following such meeting and ending with the close of business on the         day of the next such meeting;  (b) When appropriate, to buy or sell in the open market, from or         to acceptance dealers and foreign accounts maintained at the Federal         Reserve Bank of New York, on a cash, regular, or deferred delivery         basis, for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at         market discount rates, prime bankers acceptances with maturities of up         to nine months at the time of acceptance that (1) arise out of the         current shipment of goods between countries or within the United         States, or (2) arise out of the storage within the United States of         goods under contract of sale or expected to move into the channels of         trade within a reasonable time and that are secured throughout their         life by a warehouse receipt or similar document conveying title to the         underlying goods; provided that the aggregate amount of bankers         acceptances held at any one time shall not exceed $100 million;  (c) To buy U.S. Government securities, obligations that are         direct obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and         interest by, any agency of the United States, and prime bankers         acceptances of the types authorized for purchase under l(b) above,         from dealers for the account of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York         under agreements for repurchase of such securities, obligations, or         acceptances in 15 calendar days or less, at rates that, unless         otherwise expressly authorized by the Committee, shall be determined         by competitive bidding, after applying reasonable limitations on the         volume of agreements with individual dealers; provided that in the         event U.S. Government securities or agency issues covered by any such         agreement are not repurchased by the dealer pursuant to the agreement         or a renewal thereof, they shall be sold in the market or transferred         to the System Open Market Account; and provided further that in the         event bankers acceptances covered by any such agreement are not         repurchased by the seller, they shall continue to be held by the         Federal Reserve Bank or shall be sold in the open market.  2. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market       operations, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs       the Federal Reserve Banks to lend U.S. Government securities held in       the System Open Market Account to Government securities dealers and to       banks participating in Government securities clearing arrangements       conducted through a Federal Reserve Bank, under such instructions as       the Committee may specify from time to time.  3. In order to ensure the effective conduct of open market       operations, while assisting in the provision of short-term investments       for foreign and international accounts maintained at the Federal       Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Open Market Committee authorizes       and directs the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (a) for System Open       Market Account, to sell U.S. Government securities to such foreign and       international accounts on the bases set forth in paragraph l(a) under       agreements providing for the resale by such accounts of those       securities within 15 calendar days on terms comparable to those       available on such transactions in the market: and (b) for New York       Bank account, when appropriate, to undertake with dealers, subject to       the conditions imposed on purchases and sales of securities in       paragraph l(c), repurchase agreements in U.S. Government and agency       securities, and to arrange corresponding sale and repurchase       agreements between its own account and foreign and international       accounts maintained at the Bank. Transactions undertaken with such       accounts under the provisions of this paragraph may provide for a       service fee when appropriate.  By unanimous vote, the Authorization for Foreign Currency       Operations was amended to reflect the new title of Manager, System       Open Market Account.  AUTHORIZATION FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS       Amended March 28, 1995  1. The Federal Open Market Committee authorizes and directs the       Federal Reserve Bank of New York, for System Open Market Account, to       the extent necessary to carry out the Committee\\'s foreign currency       directive and express authorizations by the Committee pursuant       thereto, and in conformity with such procedural instructions as the       Committee may issue from time to time:  A. To purchase and sell the following foreign currencies in the         form of cable transfers through spot or forward transactions on the         open market at home and abroad, including transactions with the U.S.         Treasury, with the U.S. Exchange Stabilization Fund established by         Section 10 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, with foreign monetary         authorities, with the Bank for International Settlements, and with         other international financial institutions:  Austrian schillings        Belgian francs                 Canadian dollars                 Danish kroner                 Pounds sterling                 French francs                 German marks                 Italian lire                 Japanese yen                 Mexican pesos                 Netherlands guilders                 Norwegian kroner                 Swedish kronor                 Swiss francs  B. To hold balances of, and to have outstanding forward contracts         to receive or to deliver, the foreign currencies listed in paragraph A         above.  C. To draw foreign currencies and to permit foreign banks to draw         dollars under the reciprocal currency arrangements listed in paragraph         2 below, provided that drawings by either party to any such         arrangement shall be fully liquidated within 12 months after any         amount outstanding at that time was first drawn, unless the Committee,         because of exceptional circumstances, specifically authorizes a delay.  D. To maintain an overall open position in all foreign currencies         not exceeding $25.0 billion. For this purpose, the overall open         position in all foreign currencies is defined as the sum (disregarding         signs) of net positions in individual currencies. The net position in         a single foreign currency is defined as holdings of balances in that         currency, plus outstanding contracts for future receipt, minus         outstanding contracts for future delivery of that currency, i.e., as         the sum of these elements with due regard to sign.  2. The Federal Open Market Committee directs the Federal Reserve       Bank of New York to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements (\"swap\"       arrangements) for the System Open Market Account for periods up to a       maximum of 12 months with the following foreign banks, which are among       those designated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve       System under Section 214.5 of Regulation N, Relations with Foreign       Banks and Bankers, and with the approval of the Committee to renew       such arrangements on maturity:  Any changes in the terms of existing swap arrangements, and the       proposed terms of any new arrangements that may be authorized, shall     be referred for review and approval to the Committee.  3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken under paragraph       1.A. above shall, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the       Committee, be at prevailing market rates. For the purpose of       providing an investment return on System holdings of foreign       currencies, or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or       received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign       central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.  4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central       banks for the coordination of foreign currency transactions. In       making operating arrangements with foreign central banks on System       holdings of foreign currencies, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York       shall not commit itself to maintain any specific balance, unless       authorized by the Federal Open Market Committee. Any agreements or       understandings concerning the administration of the accounts       maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with the foreign       banks designated by the Board of Governors under Section 214.5 of       Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the       Committee.  5. Foreign currency holdings shall be invested insofar as       practicable, considering needs for minimum working balances. Such       investments shall be in liquid form, and generally have no more than       12 months remaining to maturity. When appropriate in connection with       arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign currency       holdings, U.S. Government securities may be purchased from foreign       central banks under agreements for repurchase of such securities       within 30 calendar days.  6. All operations undertaken pursuant to the preceding paragraphs       shall be reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee and       the Committee. The Foreign Currency Subcommittee consists of the       Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman of the       Board of Governors, and such other member of the Board as the Chairman       may designate (or in the absence of members of the Board serving on       the Subcommittee, other Board members designated by the Chairman as       alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee,       his alternate). Meetings of the Subcommittee shall be called at the       request of any member, or at the request of the Manager, System Open       Market Account (\"Manager\"), for the purposes of reviewing recent or       contemplated operations and of consulting with the Manager on other       matters relating to his responsibilities. At the request of any       member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and       consultations shall be referred for determination to the Federal Open       Market Committee.  7. The Chairman is authorized:  A. With the approval of the Committee, to enter into any needed         agreement or understanding with the Secretary of the Treasury about         the division of responsibility for foreign currency operations between         the System and the Treasury;  B. To keep the Secretary of the Treasury fully advised concerning         System foreign currency operations, and to consult with the Secretary         on policy matters relating to foreign currency operations;  C. From time to time, to transmit appropriate reports and         information to the National Advisory Council on International Monetary         and Financial Policies.  8. Staff officers of the Committee are authorized to transmit       pertinent information on System foreign currency operations to       appropriate officials of the Treasury Department.  9. All Federal Reserve Banks shall participate in the foreign       currency operations for System Account in accordance with paragraph 3       G(1) of the Board of Governors\\' Statement of Procedure with Respect to       Foreign Relationships of Federal Reserve Banks dated January 1, 1944.  By unanimous vote, the Foreign Currency Directive shown below       was reaffirmed.  FOREIGN CURRENCY DIRECTIVE       Reaffirmed March 28, 1995  1. System operations in foreign currencies shall generally be       directed at countering disorderly market conditions, provided that       market exchange rates for the U.S. dollar reflect actions and behavior       consistent with the IMF Article IV, Section 1.  2. To achieve this end the System shall:  A. Undertake spot and forward purchases and sales of foreign         exchange.  B. Maintain reciprocal currency (\"swap\") arrangements with         selected foreign central banks and with the Bank for International         Settlements.  C. Cooperate in other respects with central banks of other       countries and with international monetary institutions.  3. Transactions may also be undertaken:  A. To adjust System balances in light of probable future needs         for currencies.  B. To provide means for meeting System and Treasury commitments         in particular currencies, and to facilitate operations of the Exchange         Stabilization Fund.  C. For such other purposes as may be expressly authorized by the         Committee.  4. System foreign currency operations shall be conducted:  A. In close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the         United States Treasury;  B. In cooperation, as appropriate, with foreign monetary         authorities; and  C. In a manner consistent with the obligations of the United         States in the International Monetary Fund regarding exchange         arrangements under the IMF Article IV.  By unanimous vote, the Procedural Instructions with Respect       to Foreign Currency Operations shown below were amended to reflect the       new title of Manager, System Open Market Account.  PROCEDURAL INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO       FOREIGN CURRENCY OPERATIONS       Amended March 28, 1995  In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and       direction of the Federal Open Market Committee as set forth in the       Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency       Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, through the Manager,       System Open Market Account (\"Manager\"), shall be guided by the       following procedural understandings with respect to consultations and       clearances with the Committee, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee, and       the Chairman of the Committee. All operations undertaken pursuant to       such clearances shall be reported promptly to the Committee.  1. The Manager shall clear with the Subcommittee (or with the       Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the       Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):  A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s         overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $300 million on         any day or $600 million since the most recent regular meeting of the         Committee.  B. Any operation that would result in a change on any day in the         System\\'s net position in a single foreign currency exceeding $150         million, or $300 million when the operation is associated with         repayment of swap drawings.  C. Any operation that might generate a substantial volume of         trading in a particular currency by the System, even though the change         in the System\\'s net position in that currency might be less than the         limits specified in 1.B.  D. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank not exceeding the         larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap         arrangement.  2. The Manager shall clear with the Committee (or with the       Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the       full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or with the       Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the       Subcommittee is not feasible in the time available):  A. Any operation that would result in a change in the System\\'s         overall open position in foreign currencies exceeding $1.5 billion         since the most recent regular meeting of the Committee.  B. Any swap drawing proposed by a foreign bank exceeding the         larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15 percent of the size of the swap         arrangement.  3. The Manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the       Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System and about any       operations that are not of a routine character.  The Manager of the System Open Market Account reported on       developments in foreign exchange markets and on System open market       transactions in foreign currencies during the period February 1, 1995,       through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee ratified       these transactions.  The Manager also reported on developments in domestic       financial markets and on System open market transactions in government       securities and federal agency obligations during the period February       1, 1995, through March 27, 1995. By unanimous vote, the Committee       ratified these transactions.  The Committee then turned to a discussion of the economic       and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over       the intermeeting period ahead. A summary of the economic and       financial information available at the time of the meeting and of the       Committee\\'s discussion is provided below, followed by the domestic       policy directive that was approved by the Committee and issued to the       Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that the       expansion of economic activity had moderated considerably in early       1995. Slower growth in consumer spending, associated in part with a       sharp decline in expenditures for motor vehicles, and weakness in       housing purchases were factors in the moderation. Despite signs of       some weakening in final demand, however, further sizable gains had       been recorded in industrial production and payroll employment, and       overall rates of resource utilization remained high. Broad indexes of       consumer and producer prices had risen more rapidly on average over       January and February, but wages had shown no sign of an acceleration.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased considerably over       January and February, although the average monthly advance was       somewhat smaller than that of 1994. Further brisk job gains were       recorded in the January-February period in manufacturing; hiring in       retail and wholesale trade and in the service-producing sector slowed       a bit; and construction payrolls changed little on balance. The       average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers remained at a       high level over the two months. The civilian unemployment rate rose       in January but fell back in February to its December level of 5.4       percent.  The expansion in industrial production also moderated in       January and February from the rapid pace of last year. Manufacturing       production grew less rapidly, with output gains down sharply in       February for consumer durable goods and construction supplies. Mining       production continued to be sluggish. By contrast, the output of       utilities surged during the January-February period as winter       temperatures, which had been unusually warm, moved back toward normal,       Capacity utilization rates, which were little changed over the first       two months of the year, remained high.  Retail sales fell in February, reversing most of a sizable       rise in January. The February declines in sales were widespread, with       slippage evident at most types of retail outlets. Most indicators of       housing activity had weakened in recent months in lagged response to       the earlier rise in mortgage interest rates. Housing starts fell       sharply in January and edged still lower in February; these declines       more than erased the gains that had been posted on balance over the       closing months of 1994. A substantial drop in sales of existing homes       in January (latest data) extended the trend that had been evident for       some months.  Shipments of nondefense capital goods recorded another       strong advance in February. Shipments of office and computing       equipment rebounded in February from declines in December and January,       and demand for most other types of equipment remained brisk. Business       outlays for heavy trucks fell back slightly in February after a surge       in January. While there were tentative signs in the recent orders       data of some deceleration in business equipment spending, the still-growing backlog of unfilled orders suggested further solid expansion       in business spending on equipment. Nonresidential construction       activity had been trending appreciably higher over the past two years;       however, a slowdown in spending by public utilities in December and       January, in an environment of uncertainty related to pending       deregulation, and a third straight monthly decline in permit issuance       for nonresidential structures in February pointed to some softening in       the uptrend.  Business inventory investment surged in January after a       slowdown in December; excluding a large increase in stocks of motor       vehicles at the wholesale and retail levels, inventories rose in       January at about the average rate of the final three quarters of 1994.       In manufacturing, inventory accumulation outpaced sales in January;       the stocks-to-sales ratio edged higher but was still near historical       lows. At wholesale establishments, inventory accumulation picked up       in January as a large rise in automotive inventories more than offset       a reduced increase in stocks of other goods. The inventory-to-sales       ratio for the sector moved higher in January but remained well within       its range of the last several years. At the retail level, inventories       jumped in January after a slight decline in December; almost all the       rise reflected increased stocks of motor vehicles. The inventory-to-sales ratio for the retail sector as a whole was unchanged in January       and remained near the middle of its range of recent years, at       automotive dealerships, the inventory-to-sales ratio rose sharply       while elsewhere the ratio edged lower.  The nominal deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services       widened sharply in January from its December level and its average       rate in the fourth quarter; some of the increase in the deficit was       due to trade with Mexico, but somewhat distorted seasonal adjustment       factors also may have been involved. The value of exports of goods       and services declined substantially in January after having increased       strongly in November and December. The value of imports rose       considerably in January, continuing the pattern of the fourth quarter.       The export losses and import gains in January were distributed widely       across major trade categories. The pace of economic recovery in the       major foreign industrial countries appeared to have moderated in       recent months. In the fourth quarter, economic activity declined in       Japan and grew more slowly in most of the other major industrial       countries; growth had picked up in Canada. Available data suggested       that in the first quarter economic expansion had slowed in all of the       major foreign industrial countries except Japan, where growth appeared       to be positive despite the Kobe earthquake.  Consumer price increases in January and February were a       little larger than the average monthly rise in 1994. Food prices were       unchanged on balance over the two-month period, while energy prices       were up only slightly. Producer prices of finished goods increased in       January and February at the same rate as consumer prices; producer       price inflation for the two months also was higher than in 1994, with       a steep rise in gasoline prices in January contributing to the pickup.       Producer prices of intermediate materials surged in the first two       months of this year after having accelerated sharply in the second       half of 1994. Average hourly earnings of private production or       nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in February after a substantial       rise in January. For the two months combined, hourly earnings       increased at about the same average monthly pace as in 1994.  At its meeting on January 31-February 1, 1995, the Committee       adopted a directive that called for increasing somewhat the existing       degree of pressure on reserve positions, taking account of a possible       rise of 1/2 percentage point in the discount rate. The directive       approved by the Committee did not include a presumption about the       likely direction of any further adjustments to policy during the       intermeeting period. Accordingly, the directive stated that in the       context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability and       sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to       economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat greater or       somewhat lesser reserve restraint would be acceptable during the       intermeeting period. The reserve conditions associated with this       directive were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2       and M3 over coming months.  On the second day of the meeting, the Board of Governors       approved an increase of one-half percentage point in the discount       rate, to 5-1/4 percent. The rise was made effective immediately and       was passed through fully to interest rates in reserve markets. Open       market operations during the intermeeting period were conducted with a       view to maintaining the tighter policy stance adopted at the meeting       and implemented immediately thereafter. The federal funds rate       averaged a little less than 6 percent over the intermeeting interval,       and adjustment plus seasonal borrowing was a little below anticipated       levels.  Financial market participants generally had expected a       firming in reserve market conditions, and consequently market interest       rates showed little immediate reaction. Subsequently, most market       interest rates declined considerably in response to both incoming data       that were seen as indicating an appreciable slowing in the pace of       economic expansion and statements by Federal Reserve officials that       were viewed as suggesting that the period of monetary policy       tightening might be coming to a close. The largest declines in yields       were concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations.       Stronger-than-expected earnings reports coupled with heightened       prospects for sustained, moderate economic expansion and continued low       inflation boosted major indexes of equity prices to record levels.  In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted value of the       dollar in terms of the other G-10 currencies fell substantially       further. The dollar\\'s decline was particularly sharp against the       Japanese yen and the German mark, and post-World War II record lows       against these two currencies were recorded. Declines in U.S. interest       rates and concerns about the persistence of large U.S. trade and       fiscal deficits appeared to have contributed to the dollar\\'s drop.       Continuing economic and financial problems in Mexico, which resulted       in further depreciation on balance of the Mexican peso against the       dollar, also seemed to add to negative sentiment toward the dollar       because the process of adjustment in the Mexican economy to the lower       value of the peso was viewed as implying reduced imports from and       increased exports to the United States.  M2 declined, and growth of M3 slowed in February after       sizable January gains; data for the first part of March pointed to       some recovery in both aggregates. M2\\'s weakness in February partly       reflected an unwinding of temporary increases in January of its       volatile components, including demand deposits, overnight repurchase       agreements, and overnight Eurodollars; the weakness also appeared to       be associated with depositor efforts to obtain higher returns by       shifting funds into market instruments. The slowdown in growth of M3       in February was entirely attributable to the decline in M2; its non-M2       component increased substantially further as banks continued to rely       heavily on managed liabilities to fund loan growth. Expansion of       total domestic nonfinancial debt had picked up a little in recent       months.  The staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that       growth of economic activity was slowing and for some period ahead       would average a little less than the rate of increase in the economy\\'s       potential output. The pace of the expansion seemed to have slackened       somewhat more than had been anticipated at the last meeting; however,       the recent declines in long-term interest rates and the rally in stock       prices were expected to provide additional support for aggregate       demand later in the year. Moreover, the substantial depreciation of       the dollar against the yen and several European currencies was acting       to offset some of the effects on demand of the previous tightening of       reserve conditions. The forecast continued to anticipate that in the       period ahead consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in       real incomes, the substantial degree to which pent-up demands had been       satisfied, and the lagged effects of earlier increases in interest       rates on the demand for durable goods. Business outlays for new       equipment would decelerate substantially in response to slower growth       of sales and profits. Homebuilding was projected to decline somewhat       further in the near term and to remain at somewhat subdued levels for       a time in reflection of the damping effects on housing demand of       slower growth in jobs and incomes and of the earlier rise in mortgage       rates. Developments in Mexico were likely to interrupt only briefly a       strong uptrend in U.S. exports, based on sustained growth in the       economies of other U.S. trading partners. Considerable uncertainty       continued to surround the federal fiscal outlook but, as in the       previous forecast, a moderate pace of deficit reduction was assumed       over the forecast horizon. In the staff\\'s judgment, the economy was       operating beyond its long-run, noninflationary capacity, and there       remained a risk that higher inflation could emerge if the expansion       did not moderate sufficiently.  In the Committee\\'s discussion of current and prospective       economic developments, the members agreed that the pace of the       economic expansion was moderating, though the extent of the slowdown       was not yet clear. The effects of the policy tightening implemented       since early 1994 seemed to be showing through in interest-sensitive       sectors, and those effects were expected to be reinforced by some       cutback in inventory accumulation from the unsustainable rates of       previous quarters. Quarters of fairly slow growth were not unusual in       a period of expansion. On the whole, however, the economy appeared to       retain considerable forward momentum, with current imbalances       seemingly of a relatively minor nature and in the process of being       corrected. Moreover, the recent declines in long-term interest rates,       if these persisted, could provide fresh support for interest-sensitive       spending later in 1995 and in 1996. While opinions differed somewhat       with respect to both the likely extent of the slowdown and the       prognosis for inflation, the members generally agreed that the economy       appeared to be on a trajectory toward a more sustainable path for       economic activity. However, a number of members expressed concern       that the slowdown might not be sufficient to relieve the persisting       pressures on labor and capital resources, thereby portending higher       inflation.  In the course of the Committee\\'s discussion, members       reported on widespread signs that business activity, while still quite       strong in many areas, was growing less rapidly on balance. Still, a       number of factors pointed to continued solid expansion. Business       sentiment was generally described as quite positive, though somewhat       less ebullient than in earlier months. Likewise, recent surveys       suggested that consumer confidence remained very favorable, though       down slightly from recent peaks by most measures. In addition to the       favorable recent developments in financial markets, bank lending       policies remained quite accommodative, although business loan growth       had slowed recently after a period of unusual strength.  In their review of developments in key sectors of the       economy, members took note of the sluggishness in consumer spending       that had emerged in recent months in much of the country. To a       considerable extent the recent weakness reflected a sharp reduction in       spending for motor vehicles, but there also were signs in the most       recent data of broader declines in spending, especially for durable       goods other than automobiles. Some reduction in spending for durable       goods could be expected in lagged response to the policy tightening       over the past year, but a few members noted that unusual weather might       have led to the temporary postponement of some discretionary       purchases. In assessing the recent spending patterns, it was       difficult to determine whether they represented a temporary pause or a       more prolonged pullback by consumers. On balance, however, growth in       consumer spending probably would slow somewhat further to a rate more       in line with the expansion in jobs and incomes. Consumer spending       would tend to be sustained, however, by the ready availability of       consumer financing and the rise in bond and stock prices, which had       strengthened household balance sheets and perhaps was helping to       bolster consumer confidence.  The housing market had weakened noticeably according to       incoming data and anecdotal reports from around the country. The       decline in home sales that began in the latter part of 1994 had       persisted, and housing starts had fallen sharply in the early part of       the year as a consequence of the weaker sales and a larger inventory       of unsold homes. Partly because of the higher mortgage rates that had       prevailed for some time, members anticipated still soft housing       demand, particularly for single-family houses. There had been some       reports that recent declines in mortgage interest rates were having a       mitigating effect. In some parts of the country, the weakness in       housing construction was being countered by further improvement in       nonresidential construction activity. In other areas where commercial       real estate conditions remained soft, declines in vacancy rates seemed       to be preparing the way for a pickup in commercial building activity.  Committee members anticipated that growth of business       investment in plant and equipment would moderate from the       extraordinary rate of the last two years but that such investment       would continue to support growth in aggregate final demand during the       forecast period. The demand for durable equipment was expected to       increase more gradually as the growth of economic activity slowed and       business profits tended to flatten out, and the available data on       equipment expenditures thus far in 1995 appeared to be in line with       that expectation. However, some anecdotal reports suggested that       investment in plant and equipment might be stronger than expected in       an environment of tight labor supply and elevated levels of capacity       utilization, intense desires to control costs and improve       competitiveness, and a still relatively low user cost of capital. The       desire for additional production capacity was reflected in spending       for the construction of commercial and industrial structures, which       remained on an uptrend.  The rapid rise in business inventories in recent quarters       had been sustainable in the context of briskly increasing final sales,       but with some further accumulation early in the first quarter and       economic growth projected to moderate, the rate of inventory       investment would have to adjust downward as well. While the timing       and extent could not be anticipated with any precision, a short-term       inventory correction process might already be under way, with firms       initiating cutbacks to production schedules to reflect smaller-than-expected gains in sales over recent months. Members noted that       inventory-to-sales ratios already were at generally low levels and       they anticipated that any desired adjustments to production would be       made quickly. In the circumstances, the size of the inventory       correction and its effect on economic activity would be limited.       Moreover, reports of inventory shortages in some industries suggested       that many firms might raise their desired inventory levels to protect       against shortfalls in materials needed in the production process.  The defeat of the balanced budget amendment in Congress had       clouded the outlook for deficit reduction. Nonetheless, a moderately       restrictive fiscal policy that would provide for some progress toward       a balanced budget during the forecast period was seen as a reasonable       assumption. One member observed that there was a risk of a more       restrictive fiscal policy arising out of the dynamics of the current       political debate. In any event, any progress toward a balanced budget       might be expected to have a favorable effect on domestic financial       markets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets.  Members commented that considerable uncertainty surrounded       the outlook for the external sector, but for now it seemed reasonable       to forecast that this sector would make a small positive contribution,       on balance, to the growth of economic activity over the forecast       period. In the near term, economic developments in Mexico were       leading to lower U.S. exports and higher imports; anecdotal reports       suggested that the effects on trade flows and local business activity       tended to be felt most strongly in states that border Mexico.       However, there were signs that conditions were stabilizing in Mexico,       and more generally the relatively robust growth projected for the       major trading partners of the United States and the lower value of the       dollar now prevailing were expected to foster improvement in the       nation\\'s trade balance.  Members noted that while the pace of the expansion evidently       had slowed, economic activity and utilization of labor and other       producer resources were still at very high levels. Prices of many       materials inputs to the production process had risen sharply, but thus       far there had been only a small pickup in consumer prices. Likewise,       the persisting tightness in many labor markets had not to this point       fostered appreciable increases in wages. The absence of a significant       rise in prices of finished goods or in wages might reflect in some       measure the lags in the inflation transmission process, the fruits of       heavy business investments in new capacity and more productive       equipment in recent years, and perhaps structural changes in business       organization that were raising the economy\\'s capacity for sustained,       noninflationary activity. Members were concerned, however, that       despite continuing competitive pressures and some recent abatement in       materials prices, business firms were reporting greater success in       passing cost increases through to prices. The depreciation of the       dollar also would add to inflationary pressures in the economy. In       these circumstances, the members generally concluded that some       increase in inflation was likely in coming months.  In the Committee\\'s discussion of monetary policy for the       intermeeting period ahead, all the members endorsed a proposal to       maintain an unchanged degree of pressure in reserve markets. The       policy tightening that had been implemented since early 1994 appeared       to be exerting a desired restraining effect on the growth of economic       activity and associated demands for goods and services. But the       extent of the slowing in growth and its effects on inflationary       pressures were not yet clear. On balance, though, the available       evidence tended to suggest that the economy might be moving toward a       growth path for economic activity that would be consistent with       limiting the uptick in inflation that was currently being experienced.       In discussing their policy choices, several members noted the       relatively steep decline in the value of the dollar. However, they       believed that policy should not be directed toward the achievement of       a specific level for the dollar but rather toward the implementation       of an effective anti-inflationary monetary policy, taking account of       all the factors bearing on the economic outlook. In current       circumstances, and given the substantial uncertainties that were       involved, the members believed that it would be prudent to pause and       assess developments before taking any further policy action.  With regard to possible adjustments to policy during the       intermeeting period, most members expressed a preference for an       asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint. These members indicated       that near-term developments were not likely to call for an adjustment       to policy in either direction. Nonetheless, with the economy expected       to be operating in the neighborhood of its potential, the recent rise       in inflation and the risk of an unexpected impulse that could ratchet       inflation even higher suggested that an asymmetric directive would be       more consistent with the Committee\\'s objective of moving over time       toward price stability. The economy retained considerable forward       momentum and, as had often happened in the past, the recent slowdown       in growth could prove to be temporary, with additional monetary       tightening needed at some point to contain inflation. In this       connection a few members indicated that further tightening might well       be needed sooner rather than later. An asymmetric directive also       would provide a clear signal of the Committee\\'s intention to resist       higher inflation.  A few members preferred a symmetric directive. These       members agreed that additional policy tightening might be needed if       inflation began to pick up. However, they saw an undesirably weaker       economic performance as being about equally likely, and in their view       this balance in the risks to the outlook called for the adoption of a       symmetric directive. The Committee\\'s determination to keep inflation       under control would be appropriately conveyed, in their view, through       future actions rather than through the adoption of a tilt toward       restraint. However, these members indicated that they could accept an       asymmetric intermeeting instruction.  At the conclusion of the Committee\\'s discussion, all the       members indicated that they preferred or could support a directive       that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve       positions and that included a bias toward the possible firming of       reserve conditions during the intermeeting period. Accordingly, in       the context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for price stability       and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to       economic, financial, and monetary developments, the Committee decided       that somewhat greater reserve restraint would be acceptable and       slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the       intermeeting period. The reserve conditions contemplated at this       meeting were expected to be consistent with moderate growth of M2 and       M3 over coming months.  At the conclusion of the meeting, the Federal Reserve Bank       of New York was authorized and directed, until instructed otherwise by       the Committee, to execute transactions in the System Account in       accordance with the following domestic policy directive:  The information reviewed at this meeting suggests         that the expansion of economic activity has moderated         considerably in early 1995. Nonfarm payroll employment         rose appreciably further in January and February, but         at a pace below the average monthly gain in 1994; the         civilian unemployment rate, after rising in January,         fell back in February to its December level of 5.4         percent. Advances in industrial production also         moderated in January and February, and capacity         utilization rates generally changed little from already         high levels. Total retail sales were about unchanged         over the two months. Housing starts have declined         somewhat after posting sizable gains on balance during         the closing months of 1994. Orders for nondefense         capital goods point to a still strong expansion of         spending on business equipment, but with tentative         signs of some deceleration; nonresidential construction         has been trending appreciably higher. The nominal         deficit on U.S. trade in goods and services widened         sharply in January from its average rate in the fourth         quarter. Broad indexes of consumer and producer prices         increased faster on average over January and February.  On February 1, 1995, the Board of Governors         approved an increase from 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent in the         discount rate, and in keeping with the Committee\\'s         decision at the January 31-February 1 meeting, the         increase was allowed to show through fully to interest         rates in reserve markets. Nonetheless, most market         interest rates have declined somewhat since the         Committee meeting; the largest declines have been         concentrated in intermediate- and long-term obligations. In foreign exchange markets, the trade-weighted         value of the dollar in terms of the other G-10         currencies was down substantially further over the         intermeeting period. The Mexican peso has continued to         depreciate against the dollar.  M2 and M3 weakened in February, though data for         the first part of March pointed to some rebound.         Growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt has picked         up a little in recent months.  The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary         and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In         furtherance of these objectives, the Committee at its         meeting on January 31-February 1 established ranges for         growth of M2 and M3 of 1 to 5 percent and 0 to 4         percent respectively, measured from the fourth quarter         of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. The Committee         anticipated that money growth within these ranges would         be consistent with its broad policy objectives. The         monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was lowered to 3 to 7 percent for the         year. The behavior of the monetary aggregates will         continue to be evaluated in the light of progress         toward price level stability, movements in their         velocities, and developments in the economy and         financial markets.  In the implementation of policy for the immediate         future, the Committee seeks to maintain the existing         degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the         context of the Committee\\'s long-run objectives for         price stability and sustainable economic growth, and         giving careful consideration to economic, financial,         and monetary developments, somewhat greater reserve         restraint would or slightly lesser reserve restraint         might be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The         contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be         consistent with moderate growth in M2 and M3 over         coming months.  Votes for this action: Messrs. Greenspan,         McDonough, Blinder, Hoenig, Kelley, Lindsey,         Melzer, Ms. Minehan, Mr. Moskow, Mses. Phillips         and Yellen.  Votes against this action: None.  It was agreed that the next meeting of the Committee would be       held on Tuesday, May 23, 1995.  The meeting adjourned at 1:15 p.m.  Donald L. Kohn       Secretary    Return to top    FOMC'"
